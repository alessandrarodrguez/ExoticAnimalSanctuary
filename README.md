# ExoticAnimalSanctuary
My final project is a game called Exotic Animal Sanctuary.
It has multiple habitats, which utilize composition to include certain animals in their respective habitats.
The user can select which habitat they want to explore.
You can build relationships with each animal, which is easy or difficult depending on their quirk and how you interact with them.
Once you have a high enough relationship level with the animal, you can add the animal to your sanctuary and view them at anytime.
There is a high score file system that tracks high scores in each playthrough, which the user can view at anytime.
Finally, the user has the option to end the game whenever from the menu.

To execute the game, you execute the Game class.
